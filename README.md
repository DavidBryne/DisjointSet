Programming Project #3 

CS 3410

Use a Disjoint Sets data structure to solve the “Galactic Breakup” problem. Note: the I/O from the problem has been modified to make it work better in Gradel. You will no longer iterate through multiple test cases; Gradel will do this for you. Your code should only solve one test case.
